# Architecture Checklist

## Core Architecture

- [ ] Central image rendering logic separated into a pure core crate
- [ ] Shared data structures and rendering primitives used by all interfaces
- [ ] Plug-in system for optional features like filters, barcode types, etc.
- [ ] Error handling with rich context (`thiserror`, `anyhow`)
- [ ] Feature flags to reduce dependency load for CLI/API-specific builds

## CLI Tool Features

- [ ] Uses `clap` or `argh` for robust argument parsing
- [ ] Supports config file loading (`.toml`, `.json`, `.yaml`)
- [ ] Subcommands:
  - [ ] `generate`: produce output from a source/template
  - [ ] `template list`: list all templates
  - [ ] `fonts install`: import fonts to user/system cache
  - [ ] `info`: display metadata about input/output images
- [ ] Input/output via files or stdin/stdout
- [ ] Hot-reload mode: watch templates/data sources for live re-rendering
- [ ] Image previews optionally shown in terminal (via ASCII/iterm preview)

## Library API Features

- [ ] Modular crate exposing both high- and low-level APIs
- [ ] Builder-style usage (`ImageBuilder::new().add_text(...).render()`)
- [ ] Accepts both in-memory and file-based inputs
- [ ] Extensible image/filter/text layout primitives
- [ ] Exports to `Vec<u8>`, `DynamicImage`, or streaming writers
- [ ] Optional hooks for:
  - [ ] Font loading
  - [ ] Custom render passes
  - [ ] Post-processing
- [ ] Optional compile-time features for minimal builds:
  - [ ] `text`
  - [ ] `barcode`
  - [ ] `filters`
  - [ ] `api`
  - [ ] `cli`

## Web API Server Features

- [ ] Built on `axum`, `actix-web`, or `warp`
- [ ] Exposed routes:
  - [ ] `POST /render`: accepts JSON + base image (multipart)
  - [ ] `GET /preview`: renders and returns a quick preview PNG
  - [ ] `GET /healthz`: health check
  - [ ] `GET /version`: API versioning
- [ ] Static file serving for template storage, preview HTML
- [ ] Token-based auth and optional IP whitelisting
- [ ] CORS support
- [ ] Optional WebSocket endpoint for continuous preview
- [ ] Rate limiting middleware

## Image Feature Set

- [x] Composable layers with Z-index and blend modes
- [ ] Text rendering with alignment, justification, dynamic wrapping
- [ ] Anchored layout (e.g., top-left, center-center, bottom-right)
- [ ] Automatic font sizing and multi-line text blocks
- [ ] Barcode generation (Code128, QR, more via `barcoders`)
- [ ] Shape drawing: lines, circles, polygons
- [ ] Effects and filters: blur, brightness, contrast, etc.
- [ ] Gradient fills and overlays
- [ ] External font injection and caching
- [ ] Templating system for reusability and batch processing
- [ ] SVG/GIF/WebP support
- [ ] JSON/CSV data ingestion for templated bulk output
- [ ] Export to PNG, JPG, SVG, and optionally PDF
- [ ] Image masking and clipping paths
- [ ] Content-aware scaling/cropping
- [ ] Text effects (shadows, outlines, 3D, glow)
- [ ] Image optimization pipeline for web delivery
- [ ] Responsive image layouts (similar to CSS media queries)
- [ ] Color palettes and theme extraction from base images
- [ ] Variable data printing with dynamic field positioning
- [ ] Raster-to-vector conversion for text/shape elements

## Scaling, Concurrency, and Job Queues

- [ ] Use of thread-safe queues for background rendering (`crossbeam`, `tokio::sync::mpsc`)
- [ ] Asynchronous API server endpoints using `tokio`
- [ ] Job queue integration:
  - [ ] In-memory queues for dev/test
  - [ ] Redis-based queue (e.g. via `bollard`, `lapin`, or `deadpool`)
- [ ] Multithreaded image processing pipeline using `rayon`
- [ ] Pooled font and image resource caches to reduce IO overhead
- [ ] Batching system for processing N templates or renders per job
- [ ] Fine-grained task parallelism: separate threads for text rendering, decoding, encoding
- [ ] Optional GPU acceleration (via `wgpu`, future)
- [ ] Metrics and instrumentation for latency tracking (`tracing`, Prometheus)
- [ ] Graceful shutdown with draining queues
- [ ] Worker thread pool sizing tunable via config/env
- [ ] Optional headless job consumer mode (e.g., `--worker` CLI mode)
- [ ] Distributed rendering farm for high-volume workloads
- [ ] Intelligent caching of render components
- [ ] Progressive/partial rendering for large batch jobs
- [ ] Preview generation with lower resolution/quality for speed
- [ ] Dynamic resource allocation based on job complexity
- [ ] Blue/green deployment support for API server
- [ ] Observability stack with tracing spans for complex operations

- [ ] Content policies for generated images
- [ ] Privacy-focused data handling with optional PII redaction
